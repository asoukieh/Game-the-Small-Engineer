## 🗺️ Game-the-Small-Engineer Roadmap

Here is the current development plan for the project.  
You can track progress, suggest new features, or contribute to any open task below!

### 🎴 Core Game
- [x] Define basic shapes and attributes (Circle, Triangle, Square)
- [x] Add 2D and 3D environment logic
- [x] Introduce Fusion and X-Change special cards
- [ ] Add Shadow, and Quantum cards
- [ ] Add **Polygon Card (T + C + S Fusion)** – combines all 3 shapes with balanced attributes
- [ ] Review and refine attribute equations for 2D & 3D play:
  - [ ] Verify current formulas:  
    - 2D: Perimeter ↓, Area/Perimeter ↑, Area/Perimeter² ↓  
    - 3D: Surface Area ↓, Volume/Surface Area ↑, Volume/Surface Area² ↓  
  - [ ] Add or adjust formulas to emphasize “engineering learning” (e.g., real geometric ratios)
  - [ ] Ensure game remains easy to calculate manually for kids
- [ ] Add beginner, intermediate, and expert rule sets
- [ ] Playtest for game balance and attribute tuning

### 🎨 Design & Art
- [x] Upload first PDF draft of front/back card designs
- [ ] Recreate attractive card images (front and back)
- [ ] Add color themes and icons for attributes
- [ ] Create printable prototype layout
- [ ] Upload visual previews to `/design/` folder

### 💻 Digital Version
- [ ] Build web prototype (shape vs shape)
- [ ] Implement Fusion, X-Change, and Polygon logic
- [ ] Add animations and sound effects
- [ ] Add online multiplayer (optional)
- [ ] Release browser demo (GitHub Pages)

### 🌌 Hologram & Real-World Representation
- [ ] Define "Goloraming" mode (AR + holographic gameplay)
- [ ] Assign each card a unique AR marker (QR/image)
- [ ] Model 3D shapes (Circle, Square, Triangle, Fusions, Polygon)
- [ ] Implement special-effect animations for Fusion, Shadow, and X-Change
- [ ] Add holographic attribute visualization (Area, Perimeter, Center)
- [ ] Create real-world engineering interactions (measure, rotate, assemble)
- [ ] Develop mobile AR viewer app (Unity, WebAR, or ARKit/ARCore)
- [ ] Launch hologram demo for classroom & STEM events

### 🧮 Educational & Engineering Mode
- [ ] Add visual explanation of geometric formulas
- [ ] Include simple formula calculator for players
- [ ] Provide real-world examples of shapes in engineering
- [ ] Add “learn by play” challenges (design your own shape)
- [ ] Publish classroom & STEM edition

### 🌍 Community & Contributions
- [ ] Create contribution guide (how to add new cards)
- [ ] Build documentation and wiki for rules
- [ ] Launch first community design challenge 🎨�


✅ Tips:

- [x] = completed
- [ ] = to do

You can update progress anytime — GitHub automatically formats these checkboxes beautifully.
